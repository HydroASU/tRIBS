Distributed Hydrologic Model *tRIBS*
=====================================

The **TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin SImulator (tRIBS)**, is fully
distributed model of hydrologic processes.

What type of processes does tRIBS model?
_________________________________________

The *tRIBS* model description can be found in [Ivanov et al. 2004a]_, [Ivanov et al. 2004b]_
and [Vivoni et al. 2004]_.

We mention a few *tRIBS* processes it models:

- Couple the vadose and saturated zones with the dynamic water table.
- Moisture infiltration waves.
- Soil moisture redistribution.
- Topography-driven lateral fluxes in the vadose and groundtable zones.
- Computes the radiation and energy balance.
- Interception, evaporation and evpotrasnpiration.
- Hydrologic and hydraulic routing.
- other.
