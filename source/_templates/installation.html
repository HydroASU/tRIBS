How To Use This Module
======================
(See the individual classes, methods, and attributes for details.)

1. Import it: ``import statemachine`` or ``from statemachine import ...``.
   You will also need to ``import re``.

2. Derive a subclass of `State` (or `StateWS`) for each state in your state
   machine::

       class MyState(statemachine.State):

   Within the state's class definition:

   a) Include a pattern for each transition, in `State.patterns`::

          patterns = {'atransition': r'pattern', ...}

   b) Include a list of initial transitions to be set up automatically, in
      `State.initial_transitions`::

          initial_transitions = ['atransition', ...]

   c) Define a method for each transition, with the same name as the
      transition pattern::

          def atransition(self, match, context, next_state):
              # do something
              result = [...]  # a list
              return context, next_state, result
              # context, next_state may be altered

      Transition methods may raise an `EOFError` to cut processing short.
